I think we should use this readme or the wiki to gather our insights.

## Steps so far
*Note:* These steps have already been done in the repository.

1. `rails new rails-books-library` generated the skeleton of the rails app with all necessary folders
2. create your own SQLite database with `rake db:create` (see Getting Started above)
3. `rails generate controller home index` to generate the first controller
